/**
 * @file pedigrees.h
 *
 * @brief Classes for manipulating pedigree objects.
 *
 * @defgroup Pedigrees Pedigrees
 *
 * @author Jim Sukha
 * @version 1.03
 
 * @req Requires a compiler that implements Cilk Plus ABI 1 or later.
 * Also uses the pedigree API as implemented in Intel Cilk
 * Plus runtime, build 2561 or higher.
 *
 *
 *
 * @section pedigree_overview Overview
 *
 * In Cilk Plus, a strand of execution can be identfied by a @b
 * pedigree, a variable-length sequence of @c uint64_t values that
 * reflect the sequence of spawns and syncs in the computation leading
 * up to that strand.
 *
 * 
 *
 * Conceptually, as a program executes, the pedigree for the currently
 * executing strand changes at the boundaries of (maximal) strands.
 * The boundaries of maximal strands occur at each @c cilk_spawn, @c
 * cilk_sync, and in each grain of a @c cilk_for.  A call to @c
 * __cilkrts_bump_worker_rank() also corresponds to a strand boundary.
 * See the following <a href=http://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/doclib/stdxe/2013/composerxe/compiler/cpp-mac/hh_goto.htm#GUID-54163CE9-E866-4C6D-B0D4-0613DD2EA984.htm>online documentation</a> for more details.
 *
 * 
 * Pedigrees in Cilk Plus preserve three important properties for any
 * execution of a Cilk Plus program:
 *
 * -# <b>Uniqueness</b>: Every maximal strand in the execution DAG has
 *    a distinct pedigree.
 * -# <b>Lexicographic ordering</b>: In any serial execution of a Cilk Plus program, 
 *    the pedigrees of strands increase in a "dictionary" ordering.
 * -# <b>Determinism</b>: For any "DAG-invariant" Cilk Plus program,
 *    i.e., a program that always generates the same execution DAG
 *    when executed on any number of workers, the pedigree for each
 *    strand in the DAG is always the same across multiple runs of the
 *    program.
 *
 * 
 * @section pedigree_example An Example
 *
 * The following program conceptually illustrates pedigrees, and also
 * provides an example program using cilkpub::pedigree objects.
 *
 * @code
 *   int main(void) {
 *      cilkpub::pedigree ped0 = cilkpub::pedigree::current();  // Gets the current pedigree
 *      int x = 0;       // ped0 starts at [0, 0].
 *
 *      cilk_spawn f();  // Pedigree inside f() starts at [0, 0, 0].
 *
 *      cilkpub::pedigree ped1 = cilkpub::pedigree::current();  // Gets the current pedigree
 *      x++;             // ped1 in this continuation is [0, 1].
 *
 *      cilk_spawn g();  // Pedigree inside g() starts at [0, 1, 0].
 *
 *      cilkpub::pedigree ped2 = cilkpub::pedigree::current();  // Gets the current pedigree
 *      x++;             // ped2 in this continuation is [0, 2].
 *
 *      h();             // Pedigree in h() starts at [0, 2].
 *                       // In h(), the pedigree may have been incremented by k, to [0, k+2].

 *      cilkpub::pedigree ped3 = cilkpub::pedigree::current();  // Gets the current pedigree
 *                       // ped3 is now [0, k+2]
 *
 *      cilk_sync;
 *
 *      cilkpub::pedigree ped4 = cilkpub::pedigree::current();  // Gets the current pedigree
 *                       // ped4 is now [0, k+3]
 *
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 *
 * @section pedigree_implementation Implementation Details
 *
 * @note This section describes the current implementation of
 * pedigrees in Cilk Plus. In general, one should not write code that
 * depends on pedigrees have specific numerical values, as the exact
 * values may change with different compiler optimizations or
 * potentially in other pedigree implementations.
 * 
 * Pedigrees can be defined in terms of a <b>pedigree stack</b> for
 * the serial execution of a Cilk program, with the least-significant
 * term of the pedigree being stored at the active end of the stack.
 * The pedigree for a strand is defined as the value of the pedigree
 * stack at the the time the strand would be executed during a serial
 * execution.
 *
 * The pedigree stack is maintained using a few simple rules.  For a
 * Cilk program that has a single user pthread, (the common case), the
 * initial pedigree stack begins with the sequence [0, 0].  The
 * pedigree stack is updated as follows:
 *  - @c cilk_spawn of @c g(): When a function @c f() spawns a
 *                             function @c g(), push an new least significant term
 *                             of "0" onto the stack.
 *  - Return from @c g(): Pop the least significant term off the pedigree stack,
 *                        then increment the new least significant term on the
 *                        stack for the continuation of the spawn of
 *                        @c g() in @c f().
 *  - Reach a @c cilk_sync: Increment the least significant term of the pedigree.
 *  - Call to @c __cilkrts_bump_worker_rank(): Increments the least significant term in the pedigree.
 *  .
 *
 *  The above description assumes the code has no @c cilk_for loops.
 *  @ref pedigree_other_details describes how @c cilk_for
 *  loops are handled.
 *
 *  Note that no action is taken to change the pedigree stack on the
 *  call of a function @c h(), even if that function @c h() itself
 *  spawns.

 *
 * The file pedigrees.h contains the @ref cilkpub::opt_pedigree class,
 * which stores a pedigree object.  This class requires a template
 * argument that specifies the number of terms to statically allocate
 * for each pedigree object.
 *
 * The cilkpub::opt_pedigree class also provides various utility
 * methods for comparing and reading a pedigree object.  This object
 * is immutable once it is constructed.
 *
 * For convenience, cilkpub::pedigree is defined as a
 * cilkpub::opt_pedigree object with a default size.
 *
 * @ref pedigrees.h also implements scoped pedigrees.  For more
 * information, see @ref cilkpub::opt_pedigree_scope.
 *
 * Note that it is possible to read in the current pedigree directly
 * using the API described in @c cilk/cilk_api.h, without using the
 * classes in Cilkpub classes.  The cilkpub::opt_pedigree and other
 * classes are provided only to make working with pedigrees simpler
 * and more convenient.
 *
 *

 * @section pedigree_other_details Other Special Cases
 *
 *  Technically, maintaining pedigrees in a @c cilk_for loop requires
 *  no special effort, since a @c cilk_for loop naturally recursively
 *  decomposes into @c cilk_spawn and @c cilk_sync statements.  This
 *  decomposition adds more terms to the pedigree than is strictly
 *  necessary, however.
 *
 *  In Cilk Plus, pedigrees for a @c cilk_for are appropriately
 *  "flattened", so that entering the body of the loop adds only
 *  lengthens the pedigree by two terms.
 *
 * @code
 *   // Suppose the initial pedigree here is [a, b, c]
 *   // Assume grain size of loop is 1.
 *   cilk_for(int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *       int x = 0;       // The pedigree for iteration i begins at  [a, b, c, i, 0]
 *       cilk_spawn f(i);
 *       x++;             // The pedigree here is [a, b, c, i, 1]
 *       cilk_sync;
 *       x++;             // The pedigree here is [a, b, c, i, 2]
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * When a @c cilk_for has a grain size which is greater than 1, by
 * default, we may only get a single pedigree for the beginning of
 * each grain, rather than each iteration.  For example, in the above
 * example, if the grain size is 10, we may have pedigrees  of
 * [a, b, c, i, 0], [a, b, c, i, 10], [a, b, c, i, 20], etc.
 * 
 * To ensure a distinct pedigree for each iteration, one can
 * explicitly call @c __cilkrts_bump_loop_rank() at the beginning of the
 * body of the @c cilk_for.
 *
 * For programs with multiple user pthreads, the most significant term
 * of the pedigree counts the pthreads created.  Thus, strands that
 * are created in Cilk computations from different pthreads still have
 * distinct pedigrees.  These pedigrees may not be deterministic,
 * however, unless the programmer creates pthreads in a deterministic
 * fashion.

 *
 * For more information about pedigrees, see @ref pedigree_refs below.
 *
 *
 *  @todo Add more extensive testing of assignment and copy construction.
 *  @todo Add performance tests.

     * @brief An object that stores a pedigree scope.
     *
     * A pedigree scope is intuitively a pedigree prefix that "scopes"
     * a set of pedigrees.
     *
     * More precisely, a pedigree <tt>[x_0, x_1, ... x_d]</tt>
     * \b scopes all pedigrees <tt> [x_0, x_1, ..., x_d + k, y_0, y_1, ... y_n] </tt> for any
     *  nonnegative @c k, The scoped pedigree in this case is
     * <tt> [k, y_0, y_1, ... y_n] </tt>.
     *
     * A pedigree scope @c s also saves a <b>stop node</b>, the @c
     * __cilkrts_pedigree node that contains the last term of the
     * pedigree for the scope.  The stop node can be used to stop
     * walking the pedigree chain early when trying to get a scoped
     * pedigree.
     *
     * A pedigree scope @c s is considered <b>active</b> if its stop
     * node is still a valid pedigree node for the computation (i.e.,
     * it hasn't been popped yet).  More precisely, a scope @c s with
     * pedigree with pedigree <tt> [x_0, x_1, ... x_{d-1}, x_d] </tt>
     * is active if there exists at least any executing strand with
     * pedigree of the form <tt>[x_0, x_1, ... x_{d-1}, z]</tt> for
     * any @c z.
     *
     * It is valid to use a @c pedigree_scope object to scope the
     * current pedigree only if it is active. If we know the current
     * pedigree falls in the scope of @c s, we can lookup the current
     * scoped pedigree by only walking up the chain of pedigrees nodes
     * up to the stop node of @c s.
     *
     * @warning The implementation of scoped pedigrees currently uses
     * an undocumented interface about the lifetimes of pointers to @c
     * __cilkrts_pedigree nodes in the pedigree chain.  We could
     * implement scoped pedigrees using only the documented pedigree
     * interface, if we were willing to walk the entire pedigree list
     * to read in a scoped pedigree.  In general, use caution with
     * scoped pedigrees.  The safest way to use a pedigree scope
     * object is to get the current scope at the beginning of a
     * function and use it only within that function.  This pedigree
     * scope is active throughout this entire function.
     *
     * @note It does not seem obvious how to check whether the current
     * pedigree is out of scope without actually walking up and
     * reading the entire current pedigree.
