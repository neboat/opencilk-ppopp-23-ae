 *
 * @brief DotMix, a deterministic parallel random-number generator (DPRNG) for Cilk.
 *
 * \defgroup DotMix DotMix DPRNG
 *
 * @author   Tao B. Schardl
 * @author   Jim Sukha
 * @version  1.0
 * @req      @ref Pedigrees

 *
 * DotMix generates pseudorandom numbers deterministically by hashing
 * pedigrees.  This implementation is derived from following paper:
 *
 *   -  <I>Deterministic parallel random-number generation for dynamic-multithreading platforms</I> 
 *      by Charles E. Leiserson, Tao B. Schardl, and Jim Sukha.
 *
 * See @ref pedigree_refs for more details.
 *
 * This module implements 4 different variants of DotMix:
 *  - \c DotMix             : Computes a dot product of the reverse pedigree with entries from a table of random values. 
 *  - \c DotMixPrime        : Same as DotMix, except all computations are performed mod p = 2^64 - 59. 
 *  - \c ForwardDotMix      : Same as DotMix, except the dot product uses the in-order pedigree. 
 *  - \c ForwardDotMixPrime : Same as ForwardDotMix, except all computations are performed mod p = 2^64 - 59. 
 *  .
 *
 * \c DotMix is expected to be the fastest variant, since a dot
 * product with the reverse pedigree can be computed without needing
 * to store the entire pedigree, and computations mod @c p are more
 * expensive than arithmetic mod 2^64.
 *
 * The results described in the paper refer to an implementation of \c
 * DotMixPrime, although thus far we have observed similar
 * performance results for all variants.
 *
 * @warning DotMix is *not* designed to provide randomness for
 * cryptography.  Do not use this random-number generator for any
 * applications such as cryptographic hashing that require strong
 * guarantees on randomness.
 *
 * For more information about DotMix and pedigrees, see @ref pedigree_refs.
 *
 *
 * @todo Test random-number quality for DotMix variants.
 * @todo Quantify more precisely some of the tradeoffs between quality and performance of the DotMix variants.  In particular some of
 *     these variants might be eliminated.
 * @todo Implement other deterministic RNGs based on pedigrees.
 *
